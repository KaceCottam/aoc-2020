# Advent of Code 2020

Hi, my name is Kace Cottam. I am a student at Washington State University.

This is my repo for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/).
I am mainly doing it in `perl` because it seems like an interesting language,
but I am also going to be doing challenges in other languages.
